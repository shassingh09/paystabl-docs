Instructions for New Documentation Repl Agent
Theme Changes Needed
Fix Dark Theme Implementation

File: docs_site/src/css/custom.css
The current theme is too pink/light - needs to match the main app's dark theme
Update CSS variables to use darker backgrounds and proper contrast
Main app uses: from-black via-zinc-900 to-black for dark backgrounds
Ensure proper dark/light mode toggle functionality
Gradient Adjustments

Current gradients are too bright pink
Should match main app: purple-to-pink but darker and more subtle
Background should be predominantly dark with purple accents
Content Architecture Changes
Current Problem: Documentation incorrectly suggests we have MCP servers and various ready-made integrations.

Reality: We have a payment kernel (backend code) that can be integrated into different agentic frameworks.

Specific Content Updates Needed:
Introduction Page (docs/introduction.mdx)

Remove references to "our MCP server"
Explain we provide payment kernel code that integrates with various frameworks
Clarify the architecture: payment backend + framework-specific tools
Integrations Section (docs/integrations/)

MCP file (mcp.mdx): Change from "Use our MCP server" to "Build MCP server integration using our payment kernel"
LangGraph file (langgraph.mdx): Show how to integrate payment kernel into LangGraph workflows
n8n file (n8n.mdx): Demonstrate n8n node creation using our payment API
Custom frameworks (custom_frameworks.mdx): Generic integration guide for any framework
Tools Section (docs/tools/)

Clarify these are utilities/helpers, not standalone servers
Show how tools work with the payment kernel
Architecture Page (docs/architecture.mdx)

Update to show: Payment Kernel → Framework Integration → Agent Implementation
Remove any references to pre-built servers we don't actually have
Examples Section (docs/examples/)

Update examples to show integration patterns, not usage of existing servers
Show code examples of integrating payment kernel into different frameworks
Key Messaging Changes:
From: "Use our MCP server"

To: "Integrate our payment kernel to build your own MCP server"

From: "Connect to our integrations"

To: "Build integrations using our payment API and tools"

The goal is accuracy - we provide the payment infrastructure and tools to build integrations, not ready-made servers for every framework.
