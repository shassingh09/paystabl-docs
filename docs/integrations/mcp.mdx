# MCP Server Integration

Integrate PayStabl with Claude via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This enables Claude to make autonomous payments for APIs and services directly through chat interactions.

## Quick Setup

Install the PayStabl MCP server:

```bash
npm install -g @paystabl/mcp-server
```

Configure Claude Desktop to use the server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paystabl": {
      "command": "paystabl-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--agent-id", "claude-assistant"],
      "env": {
        "PAYSTABL_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### `pay_for_api`
Automatically handle HTTP 402 payment requests:

```
User: "Get the premium weather data for London"
Claude: I'll get the premium weather data for you.

[Uses pay_for_api tool internally]
- Calls weather API
- Receives 402 Payment Required  
- Automatically pays via PayStabl
- Retries request with payment header
- Returns weather data

Here's the current weather in London: [data]
Payment: $0.25 (Receipt: tx_abc123)
```

### `pay_agent`
Send payments to other agents:

```
User: "Pay the summarization agent $0.50 for the report"
Claude: I'll send the payment to the summarization agent.

[Uses pay_agent tool]
Payment sent successfully!
- Amount: $0.50
- Recipient: summarization_agent_001
- Transaction: 0x1234...
- Purpose: Report summarization service
```

### `check_balance`
View current wallet balance:

```
User: "What's my agent balance?"
Claude: [Uses check_balance tool]

Your agent wallet currently has:
- Balance: 2.45 ETH ($4,850.32)
- Available for payments: $4,800.00
- Reserved funds: $50.32
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Agent Setup

Create a specialized agent configuration:

```javascript
// paystabl-config.js
module.exports = {
  agentId: "claude-premium",
  policies: {
    dailyLimit: "100.00",
    perCallLimit: "5.00", 
    allowedDomains: [
      "api.openweathermap.org",
      "api.premium-data.com",
      "summarization-agent.com"
    ],
    requireApproval: {
      threshold: "10.00"
    }
  },
  integrations: {
    enableX402: true,
    enableAgentPayments: true,
    logTransactions: true
  }
};
```

Start the MCP server with the config:

```bash
paystabl-mcp-server --config ./paystabl-config.js
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Full configuration for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paystabl": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@paystabl/mcp-server/dist/index.js",
        "--agent-id", "claude-assistant",
        "--config", "./paystabl-config.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PAYSTABL_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "PAYSTABL_NETWORK": "base-sepolia"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Premium API Access

Claude can automatically handle paid API requests:

```
User: "Analyze this PDF document for me"

Claude: I'll analyze the PDF using a premium document processing service.

[Internally:]
1. Attempts to call PDF analysis API
2. Receives 402 Payment Required ($2.50)
3. Uses pay_for_api to generate payment
4. Retries request with X-Payment header
5. Receives analysis results

Here's the analysis of your PDF document:
[Analysis results...]

Payment processed: $2.50 (Transaction: 0x5678...)
```

### Agent Collaboration

Claude can pay other agents for specialized tasks:

```
User: "Get a legal review of this contract"

Claude: I'll send this contract to our legal analysis agent for review.

[Uses pay_agent to compensate legal agent]
Payment sent: $15.00 to legal_review_agent

[Receives legal analysis]
Here's the legal review of your contract:
[Detailed legal analysis...]

Payment completed successfully.
```

### Multi-Step Workflows

Claude can orchestrate complex paid workflows:

```
User: "Create a research report on AI trends"

Claude: I'll create a comprehensive research report using multiple specialized services:

1. Gathering data from premium research APIs...
   ✓ Paid $3.00 for market data access
   
2. Getting industry analysis...
   ✓ Paid analysis_agent $5.00 for trend analysis
   
3. Generating visualizations...
   ✓ Paid chart_agent $2.00 for data visualization
   
4. Professional formatting...
   ✓ Paid formatting_agent $1.50 for document layout

Total spent: $11.50

Here's your comprehensive AI trends research report:
[Complete formatted report with charts and analysis]
```

## Error Handling

The MCP server includes robust error handling:

### Insufficient Funds
```
Claude: I attempted to access the premium data service, but your agent wallet has insufficient funds. 

Current balance: $0.45
Required payment: $2.50

Please fund your agent wallet to continue.
```

### Policy Violations
```
Claude: The payment request ($25.00) exceeds your daily limit of $20.00. 

Would you like me to:
1. Request approval for this higher amount
2. Use a different service with lower cost
3. Split the request into smaller parts
```

### API Errors
```
Claude: I encountered an issue with the payment processing:

Error: The target API doesn't support x402 protocol
Alternative: I can try a different service that supports PayStabl payments.
```

## Security Features

### Transaction Logging
All payments are logged with full context:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "agentId": "claude-assistant", 
  "action": "pay_for_api",
  "amount": "2.50",
  "recipient": "api.premium-service.com",
  "purpose": "PDF document analysis",
  "txHash": "0x1234...",
  "userContext": "User requested PDF analysis",
  "success": true
}
```

### Policy Enforcement
- Daily spending limits
- Per-transaction limits  
- Domain allowlists
- Approval workflows for large payments
- Time-based restrictions

### Audit Trail
```
User: "Show me my recent payments"

Claude: Here are your recent PayStabl transactions:

Today (Jan 15, 2024):
- $2.50 → PDF Analysis API (10:30 AM)
- $5.00 → Research Agent (11:15 AM) 
- $1.25 → Translation Service (2:20 PM)
Total: $8.75

This week: $45.30
This month: $156.80

All transactions are recorded on-chain for full transparency.
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Starting
```bash
# Check if PayStabl MCP server is installed
npm list -g @paystabl/mcp-server

# Verify configuration
paystabl-mcp-server --verify-config

# Check logs
tail -f ~/.claude/mcp-logs/paystabl.log
```

### Payment Failures
```bash
# Test PayStabl connection
paystabl-mcp-server --test-connection

# Verify agent wallet
paystabl-mcp-server --check-balance

# Validate API key
paystabl-mcp-server --validate-key
```

### Claude Integration Issues

1. **Tools not appearing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
2. **Permission denied**: Check MCP server permissions and API key
3. **Network errors**: Verify internet connection and firewall settings

## Best Practices

### Agent Wallet Management
- Start with testnet for development
- Set reasonable daily limits ($10-50)
- Monitor spending regularly
- Keep wallet funded but not over-funded

### User Communication
- Always inform users about payments before processing
- Show payment amounts and recipients clearly
- Provide transaction receipts
- Explain the value provided for each payment

### Error Recovery
- Gracefully handle payment failures
- Suggest alternatives when payments fail
- Provide clear next steps for resolution
- Log errors for debugging
