# What is PayStabl?

PayStabl is a programmable wallet infrastructure platform that empowers AI agents with autonomous onchain transaction capabilities. It provides CDP-powered smart wallets with policy governance, session controls, and seamless M2M (machine-to-machine) commerce capabilities.

## The Problem

Traditional payment systems weren't designed for autonomous AI agents. Current challenges include:

- **Manual Payment Flows** - Agents can't handle payment requests without human intervention
- **No Micropayment Support** - High fees make small API payments uneconomical
- **Complex Integration** - Each payment provider requires custom implementation
- **Limited Agent Autonomy** - Agents can't make purchasing decisions independently

## The Solution

PayStabl enables true autonomous commerce through:

### 🤖 Agent-Native Design
- Programmable wallets designed specifically for AI systems
- Policy-based spending controls and session management
- Automatic transaction handling without human intervention

### 💳 x402 Protocol Integration
- Native support for HTTP 402 "Payment Required" responses
- Automatic payment header generation and request retry logic
- Seamless integration with existing API architectures

### 🔗 Inter-Agent Commerce
- Direct agent-to-agent payment capabilities
- Compensation for tool usage, data access, and compute resources
- Built-in reputation and trust mechanisms

### 🛡️ Enterprise Security
- Gasless transactions via paymaster integration
- Multi-signature wallet support for team agents
- Comprehensive audit trails and compliance reporting

## Key Features

### Programmable Wallets
Each agent gets a smart contract wallet with:
- Configurable spending limits and policies
- Session-based allowances for temporary operations
- Multi-sig support for high-value transactions
- Gas abstraction for seamless user experience

### Policy Governance
- **Spending Limits** - Daily, weekly, or per-transaction caps
- **Allowlists** - Restrict payments to approved services only
- **Time-based Controls** - Enable payments during specific hours
- **Amount Thresholds** - Require approval for large transactions

### Framework Integration
Pre-built integrations for popular AI frameworks:
- **Claude MCP Server** - Tool-based payment integration
- **LangGraph** - Payment-enabled workflow nodes
- **Custom Runtimes** - SDK for any agent framework

## Use Cases

### API Monetization
- Convert existing APIs to paid services with x402 headers
- Automatic micropayment handling for per-request pricing
- Dynamic pricing based on usage patterns or demand

### Agent Collaboration
- Agents paying each other for specialized services
- Distributed compute marketplaces
- Data sharing and processing pipelines

### Autonomous Services
- Self-managing SaaS subscriptions
- Dynamic resource provisioning
- Automated vendor payments
